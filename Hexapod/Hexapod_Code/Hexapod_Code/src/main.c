 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This application provides an example usage of the PWMA module on UC3
 * products. This example shows how to configure a PWMA and output it on a
 * GPIO.
 *
 * <b>Operating mode</b>:\n Check the used PWMA pin with an oscilloscope, you
 * should see a PWM square wave with varying duty-cycle.
 * - On \b UC3-L0 Xplained, the pin is connected to the red color on the
 *   RGB-LED, showing a cycling fade-out effect.
 * - On \b UC3L-EK, the PWMA-pin is connected to LED0.
 * - On \b STK600-RC3UC3D, the PWMA-pin is connected to PORTA.PA07.
 *

 * - pwma.c: PWMA driver;
 * - pwma.h: PWMA driver header file;
 * - pwma_example.c: PWMA example application.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC for AVR32 and IAR Systems compiler
 * for AVR32. Other compilers may or may not work.
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All AVR32 devices with a PWMA module can be used. This example has been
 * tested with the following setup:
 * - UC3-L0 Xplained
 * - UC3L-EK
 * - STK600-RC3UC3D
 *
 * \section setupinfo Setup Information
 * CPU speed: <i>Internal 120MHz RC oscillator set to run at 15MHz</i>.
