v1.0 boards:

* six pin header to Arduino in lower left corner is .05" too far to the left
* Y driver's power and motor pins are .100" too far to the left
* can we add .100" of space between the driver boards?
* A's step and direction pins are not connected.
* Check spacing of digital 8-15 from 0-7 - too close by a tiny ammount.

All of the above are fixed in the v1.1 design. (06/17/2011)
