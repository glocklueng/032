Go to the tools directory and type "make". The only tools you really need from
this directory are "space" and "mkstory", so don't worry if the other tools
won't build for some reason.

Next, go to the craft directory and type "make". This should create flash.hex
and eeprom.raw. Verify that they are identical to what you've got in the
../firmware directory.

The music data (song.S, songee.S) was obviously generated with a tool, a
custom tracker, but I won't release the source code for the tracker (yet)
because it depends on a library I'm working on, and the library is not fully
functional yet.
