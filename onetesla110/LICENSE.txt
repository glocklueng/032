A word on licensing:
--------------------
While most of oneTesla's design is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License, an extremely permissive
"copyleft" license that permits content to be re-used in any circumstances so long as said derivative works are
licensed under the same terms, these board files are licensed under the Creative Commons 
Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license. What this means to you, the end-user is that you may NOT sell any
works based on these files. In particular, you may not sell circuit boards, kits, or Tesla coils based on oneTesla's
design.
Why the restrictive license? Well, oneTesla is a fairly hazardous product. By restricting third-party sellers, we
ensure that low-quality clones which use unreliable components or otherwise cut corners cannot exist. With that being
said, if you want to sell something based on oneTesla's design, contact us at nikola@onetesla.com - we may be willing
to relax the terms or license the files to you under an alternate license.
