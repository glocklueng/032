		If the Camera is assigned to a Head the Location is the offset from the center of the tool
		holder to the center of the focal point of the Camera.
		
		To configure this offset, do the following:
		Measure the length of a tool and record this length as "toolLength".
		Place the tool in the tool holder.
		Touch off the tool to an object that you can use the Camera to focus on and record the 
		position of the Head as "touch".
		Now move the Camera to the center of the part that you touched off on and move the head until
		the Camera is in perfect focus and record the position of the Head as "focus".
		To calculate the offset, take touch.X - focus.X for X, touch.Y - focus.Y for Y and
		touch.Z - focus.Z + toolLength for Z.
		
		If the Camera is stationary the Location is the absolute machine coordinates of the
		center of the focal point of the camera..
