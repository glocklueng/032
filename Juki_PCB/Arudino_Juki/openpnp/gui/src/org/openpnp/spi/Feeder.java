/**
 * A Feeder is an abstraction that represents any type of part source. 
 * It can be a tape and reel feeder, a tray handler, a single part in a 
 * specific location or anything else that can be used as a pick source.
 * 
 * When a Feeder is first configured as part of machine setup it is not
 * given a Part to handle. This is because in the case of something like a
 * reel the user may swap different Parts into the same Feeder without
 * needing to reconfigure the Feeder.
 * 
 * For instance, if the Feeder is setup to feed 5mm cut tape, the user
 * may run a 0805 resistor in the Feeder for one job and a 0805 capacitor
 * in the same Feeder for a different job.
