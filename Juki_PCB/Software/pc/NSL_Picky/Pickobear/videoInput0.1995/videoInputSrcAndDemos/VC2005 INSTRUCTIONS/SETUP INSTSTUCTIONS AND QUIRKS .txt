-- LINKER ERRORS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:

If you get a linker error C2146 for winnt.h or error C4430 in ctlutil.h

the problem here is that this member operator function does not have a return type:

    operator=(LONG);

Change it to:

    COARefTime& operator=(LONG);


Read about it here:

-- LINKER SETTINGS FOR MAKING STATIC LIB:

Make sure you have your Additional Dependecies in ProjectSettings->Librarian->General set to:
dxguid.lib ole32.lib  strmiids.lib uuid.lib

And Link Library Dependencies: set to yes.
When it compiles you will get a LOT of warnings but it should build fine - nice static lib. 


-- LINKER SETTINGS FOR USING COMPILED LIB

If you get an error about atlthunk.lib add this to your ProjectSettings->Linker->Command Line
/NODEFAULTLIB:"atlthunk"

I also have
/NODEFAULTLIB:"LIBCMT"  


-- OTHER DEBUGGING ---
Look through how the example apps settings are set in project properties.
Check if there is something there that you are missing from your project settings.
