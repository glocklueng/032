INFO:Cpld - Inferring BUFG constraint for signal 'i_HClk' based upon the LOC
   constraint 'P9'. It is recommended that you declare this BUFG explicitedly in
   your design. Note that for certain device families the output of a BUFG
   constraint can not drive a gated clock, and the BUFG constraint will be
   ignored.
ERROR:Cpld:892 - Cannot place signal o_RAddr<10>. Consider reducing the
   collapsing input limit or the product term limit to prevent the fitter from
   creating high input and/or high product term functions.
ERROR:Cpld:868 - Cannot fit the design into any of the specified devices with
   the selected implementation options.
