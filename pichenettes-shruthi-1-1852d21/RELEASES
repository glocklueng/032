v0.92 (work in progress) -------------------------------------------------------

UI

- Patches can be tweaked from the load/save page. In this case, the 4 knobs have
the functions assigned to them in the performance page for this patch.
- The Shruthi-1 can be configured to boot directly on the presets page (aka
"presets mode").
- Non-blocking ADC scanning increases UI responsiveness.
- The "mix" and "osc 1" pages have been modified. The sub-oscillator settings
are now on the same page as the oscillator 1 settings.
- Holding the load/save switch (S6) pressed down while rotating the encoder
allows the values to be incremented/decremented by steps of 10.
Useful for browsing patches!

SYSTEM

- Different options are available for using the 4 CV: 4 CV ins (assignable in
mod matrix -- default setting), 32-knobs programmer, or simple mapping to
cutoff, param1/param2 for pedals and joystick.
- External eeproms larger than 64kb are supported, up to 512kb. Note that when
a 512kb eeprom is used, the last 64kb block is not used (this is due to the
fact that 16-bit arithmetic is used to compute addresses, and that the
address space includes the 16kb of the internal eeprom).

MIDI

- SysEx Patch request command (0x11 0x00). Upon reception of this command, the
Shruthi dumps the currently edited patch. Might be useful for an editor!
- Support for NRPN increment/decrement.
- The SysEx backup protocol has been extended to support backing up / restoring
more than 16kb of patch data.
- A bank and program change message is sent whenever a preset is loaded.
- Bank change messages are handled, to allow patches above 128 to be loaded.
- Volume change messages (CC 7) are handled.

SYNTHESIS

- The shape of the envelope (approximation of an exponential) has been refined.
- The "2 bits" modulation destination is gone, since there are now better ways
(extra TX pin, shift register out) to communicate with a filter board.
- A new modulation destination (replacing "2 bits") allows the attack of both
envelopes to be sped up. This settings is particularly useful when velocity
is used as a modulation source.
- The "digital silencing" of oscillators when envelopes have reached zero has
been improved. The oscillators are now digitally silenced whenever the VCA
destination in the modulation matrix has reached a value of zero.
- The noise source in the mixer is now refreshed at 40kHz instead of 10kHz,
giving it a richer timbre.
- The phase counters are now 24 bits instead of 16 bits. This allows more subtle
detuning effects between the oscillators, especially in the lowest notes.
- The audio engine has been rewritten from a "breadth first" to a "depth first"
perspective, and as a result, is faster.
- As a result of the audio engine rewrite, the vowel oscillator can now be used
with the noise and sub generators.
- To make more room for upcoming feature, the waves wavetable has been
downsampled to 128 samples/waveform instead of 256.
- New mixing mode (>>4, >>8) allows the oscillators signal to be
bitcrushed (sample rate reduction with a S&H).

CODE

- Code size optimization saved 460 bytes.
- The modulation matrix processing code has been simplified.
- A menu in the UI and code infrastructure is ready to provide filter-board
specific menus and parameters in future firmware revisions.
