Shruthi-1, a better digital/analog hybrid MIDI monosynth.

This project is a redesign of the original Shruti-1, with a spec'ed up CPU,
and a focus on easy upgrades/modification of the analog section.
The ATMega644p allows new features in the firmware -- a larger selection of
oscillator algorithms, a bigger selection of wavetables, and a tiny sequencer.

Original developer: Olivier Gillet (ol.gillet@gmail.com)

# reimplementation of the formant synthesis algorithm used in Peter Knight's
# Cantarino speech synthesizer.
